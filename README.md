# Nunni

##### For the lack of a better name (reference from one of SNL's sketches)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##### TODO - 
1. Authentication
2. MongoDB support
3. Redis
4. Python based cron job (concurrent process) for sending out emails
5. Elastic Search possibly replace with socketIO

##### Getting Started -
1. ``` git clone https://github.com/rohitkeshav/pic-sy.git ```
2. ``` npm install ```
3. ``` npm start ``` - starts the react process only, electron is silenced for the purpose of debugging
